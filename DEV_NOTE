The changes to this repo are attempting to make zigbee publish mqtt
just like esphome does.

To publish the changes:
 1. Commit and push to fork, git push fork
 2. From hassio-zigbee2mqtt local repo, run `common/local_build.sh`
 3. Delete the old image, and install the new version in Home Assistant
